# This is the complementary Data Science Toolbox project README.md

## Guiding Questions and Topics
- Can you find any correlation between the government measures and COVID-19 cases and fatalities? 
    - Explore the already taken EU-wide government measures in the past and its correlation with COVID-19 cases and fatalities
- The following countries should be taken into account: 
    - Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Sweden
- What could be a valuable timeframe within the measures to see first results in the correlation?
- Do you find any correlation within measures “ClosPrim”, “ClosPubAny”, “IndoorOver500”, 
    - which were used several times, 
    - in the different countries?
- Does this correlation indicate causation and why?
- Can you find any trend in different demographics within the population (e.g. male/female) ?
- Think beyond what else could be analyzed from the data?
