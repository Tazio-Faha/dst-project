# Research Questions DST Project

Which questions are relevant to answer?

## Given Research Questions

- Can you find any correlation between the government measures and COVID-19 cases and fatalities?
    - What could be a valuable timeframe within the measures to see first results in the correlation?
- Do you find any correlation within measures “ClosPrim”, “ClosPubAny”, “IndoorOver500”, 
    - which were used several times, 
    - in the different countries?
- Is there any trend in different demographics within the population?
    - Can you find any trend in different demographics within the population (e.g. male/female)?
- Does this correlation indicate causation and why?

## Additional research questions

- What influence did measures have on citizen mobility?
    - Did a closure of public places affect mobility / cases?
    - Did a lockdown affect mobility / cases?
- Is there a correlation between vaccination rates and measures?
- Is there a correlation between hospital/ICU occupations and measures? -> Sadly no data on occupation percentage...
- Is there a correlation between tests and measures?
- Did age-groups influence cases/measures?
    - Did a Close Prime Schools reduce the amount of cases in age group 0-14?
    - Did a Close Second School reduce the amount of cases in age group 14-18?
    - Did a Close Higher reduce the amount of cases in age group 18+?
    - Did a Reccomendation for voulentary lockdown for eldery and risk reduce cases for eldery?
- What influence did the different covid variants have on measures and cases?

- How are we supposed to use the data from the World bank?
- Yearly aggregated data
    - Age Data and so on...

- Does the time of the measure affect the efficiency?
- How effiecient is a measure in the first week vs. in the later days?

## Model verification approach
- Can we model the effect of measures and then check whether they work?

## Most interesting Measures
- Masks
- Lockdowns / Closures of spaces or public places
- Close for specific demographics
- Teleworking
